# My Personal Project


### What will the application do?

Shortly, the application will allow a user to build a sandwich in addition to displaying the pricing of each topping added to the sandwich. The application may first promt the user to choose either a meal, or just a sandwich and the size of the sandwich (6 inch or 12 inch). The meal could include a sandwich + pop + a bag of chips. The user having chosen that, they then get to pick what type of bread they want, type of meat/tofu, type of cheese and whether it should be toasted or not. After that, the user can pick the various greens they want added to their sandwich. Finally, the user is prompted to pick 0-4 sauces that they can add to their sandwich. If a meal is picked, the user can pick the soda/water and the chips they want. Finally, the user can head to checkout where a price with a breakdown can be viewed. 

### Who will use it?

Someone who wants to order a sandwich/meal, provided that there is a store that this application is linked to. Local sandwich shops needing to expand and advertise themselves can use this application which would allow more people to get to know the shop.  

### Why is this project of interest to you?

Food-ordering applications like Uber Eats and DoorDash are so dominant and successful nationwide. I believe creating an application similar to these are a great first step to my future in Computer Science.
